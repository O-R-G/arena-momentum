      <p>An artwork has the choice of two fates. One is to live in cold storage, a safe zone, fully insured. It has travel companions and guardians and is rarely on view for a public encounter — and rarely encounters other works of art. The second claims a life of activity, travels the world in its own shipping container, enjoys cultural diversity, locals, and international guests, and collects a patina of time and use.</p>

      <p>Arena was designed for an itinerant life: it comes apart easily, packs up easily, unpacks easily, installs and deinstalls quickly. Its cycle is about fluidity and flexibility. Its 4 × 4 meter modular components are interchangeable, which allows different parts of Arena to be in many places at once, if so desired.</p>

      <p>Arena becomes an arena when animated by people in an ongoing and open process that is punctuated by choreographed engagements. For the duration of the presentation at <a href="https://www.diaart.org/exhibition/exhibitions-projects/rita-mcbride-arena-momentum-exhibition" target="new">Dia Beacon</a>, an expanding body of artists, performers, writers, musicians, and dancers activated physical and virtual spaces as part of a series of engagements with Arena. The series, collectively called Momentum, is initiated by <a href="https://www.ritamcbride.net" target="new">Rita McBride</a> with experimental performance collective <a href="http://www.discotecaflamingstar.com" target="new">discoteca flaming star</a> (founded by Cristina Gomez Barrio and Wolfgang Mayer) and artist and choreographer <a href="https://alexandrawaierstall.com" target="new">Alexandra Waierstall</a>.</p>

      <p>Momentum was active at Dia Beacon on the following dates: <a href="https://www.diaart.org/program/past-programs/momentum-manifesto-rita-mcbride-and-david-reinfurt-dia-talks-09092023/year/2023" target="new">September 9, 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.diaart.org/program/past-programs/momentum-performance-10132023/year/2023" target="new">October 13–15, 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.diaart.org/program/past-programs/momentum-performance-02242024/year/2024" target="new">February 24, 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.diaart.org/program/past-programs/momentum-performance-05102024/year/2024" target="new">May 10 & 12, 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.diaart.org/program/past-programs/momentum-performance-10252024/year/2024" target="new">October 25–27, 2024</a>.</p>

      <p>This website collects documents from these events, hosted on a series of <a href="https://are.na" target="new">** Are.na</a> channels, and runs on a schedule generated daily. The schedule ensures that every visitor to the website views the same material at the same time. And it keeps moving.</p>
